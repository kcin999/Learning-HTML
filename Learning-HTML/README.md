# Learning-HTML
Repository so that I can learn HTML, CSS, and refresh on JS.  Just wanted to see what I could come up with when it comes to stuff like this. 

Trying to do this without third part stuff first to see if I can do it (i.e. without bootstrap, etc)

I am using Chrome for right now to develop everything

## Things I want to do:
- [ ] Edit looks of the website
    - [ ] Scaling of all everything with window size so it looks good
	- [ ] Add Pictures
	- [x] Make more modern, rather than just text. (I like the black clean look)
        - [ ] Slideshow elements about me.  (Xavier, STL, PowerBI etc)
	- [ ] Scrollable Page
    - [x] Side Navigation Bar. 
        - Helps the site look a lot better and clean. Need to learn how to update the rest of the page for that clean look
- [ ] Create some Basic Games
	- [x] Pong
        - [x] Need to create scoreboard
        - [ ] Pause button
	- [x] Brick Breaker 
        - [ ] Tables for Scores
    - [x] Create Database in MySQL for High Scores
    - [ ] Instruction Pages for both
- [ ] Embed some API Calls
    - [ ] Github API
    - [ ] Other Datapints
- [x] Hosting
    - [x] Learn how to host the site on Local Host
        * (I think this is done through Apache)
        * Can confirm.  I am using apache2 through XAMPP on a linux VM
    - [x] Host my own instance of a SQL database. 
        - Done through XAMPP

- [ ] Baseball Database
