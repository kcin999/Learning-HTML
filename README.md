# Learning-HTML
Repository so that I can learn HTML, CSS, and refresh on JS.  Just wanted to see what I could come up with when it comes to stuff like this. 

Trying to do this without third part stuff first to see if I can do it (i.e. without bootstrap, etc)

## Things I want to do:
- [ ] Edit looks of the website
	- [ ] Add Pictures
	- [ ] Make more modern, rather than just text
        - [ ] Slideshow elements about me.  (Xavier, STL, PowerBI etc)
	- [ ] Scrollable Page
- [ ] Create some Basic Games
	- [ ] Pong
	- [ ] Brick Breaker 
- [ ] Embed some API Calls
    - [ ] Github API
    - [ ] Other Datapints
- [ ] Hosting
    - [x] Learn how to host the site on Local Host
        * (I think this is done through Apache)
        * Can confirm.  I am using apache2 through XAMPP on a linux VM
    - [x] Host my own instance of a SQL database. 
        - Done through XAMPP
